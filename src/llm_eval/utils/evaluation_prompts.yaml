  Evaluation Criteria:
      1. Correctness [1-5]: Assesses how thoroughly the model's answer addresses the key points and requirements of the question compared to the expert answer.
      2. Specificity [1-5]: Evaluates the depth of agriculture-specific knowledge in the model's response relative to the expert answer.
      3. Conciseness [1-5]: Rates the efficiency of the model's response in using words while covering the required information compared to the expert answer. Where 1 indicates a Verbose answer and 5 a highly efficient one. Brevity without meaningful or relevant information should receive a low score.

          4: Highly relevant agricultural knowledge, near expert level.
          5: Matches or exceeds expert-level agriculture knowledge.

      - Conciseness:
          1: Verbose, inefficient response.
          2: Over-detailed with unnecessary information.
          3: Balanced and clear.
          4: Concise and focused on essentials.
          5: Efficient and precise.

  Evaluation Steps:
      1. Understand the Question: Identify its key requirements and scope.
      2. Understand the Expert Answer: Determine its key points, agricultural specificity, and conciseness.
      3. Understand the Model's Answer: Determine its key points, agricultural specificity, and conciseness.
      4. Correctness Analysis: Assess whether the model's answer fully addresses the key points from the expert answer.
      5. Specificity Analysis: Determine if the model's answer demonstrates agricultural specificity in alignment with the expert answer.
      6. Conciseness Analysis: Determine how efficiently the model's answer conveys information compared to the expert answer, ensuring that the response is not only concise but also meaningful.
      7. Assign Scores: Using the Evaluation Criteria and the relative Scoring Sheet, assign scores for Correctness, Specificity, and Conciseness based on your analyses.

query_prompt_procedural: |
  You will be given a question, an expert answer (ground truth), and a model-generated answer. In this task, both responses present procedures in a step-by-step format. Your task is to evaluate the model’s answer using the defined evaluation criteria and the corresponding scoring sheet. Follow the outlined steps systematically, providing a detailed analysis for each step before assigning scores for the criteria.
  ---
  Evaluation Criteria:
      1. Procedural Accuracy [1-5]: Assesses whether the model's answer covers all the essential steps and intermediate actions required to achieve the intended outcomes as specified by the expert answer.
      2. Procedural Flow [1-5]: Evaluates whether the procedure is presented in a clear, sequential order with well-divided steps that are practically feasible and closely aligned with the structure of the expert answer.
      3. Conciseness [1-5]: Rates the efficiency of the model's answer in terms of both the number of steps and the length of each step relative to the expert answer. Maximum scores can be awarded even if the number of steps differs, provided that the conveyed information is equivalent and communicated efficiently.

  Scoring Sheet:
      - Procedural Accuracy:
          1: Largely incorrect; several essential steps are missing.
          2: Partially correct; multiple key steps are missing or inaccurate.
          3: Mostly correct but lacks some critical components.
          4: Nearly all steps are present with minor omissions.
          5: Fully accurate; all necessary steps and actions are included.

      - Procedural Flow:
          1: Extremely disorganized and illogical.
          2: Poorly organized with gaps in logical flow.
          3: Generally logical but with uneven step divisions.
          4: Well organized with minor deviations from the expert answer.
          5: Very clear and logically sequenced.

      - Conciseness:
          1: Verbose and inefficient.
          2: Overly detailed with unnecessary information.
          3: Balanced but with some extra detail.
